//! Where the buyer's payout was sent, and what became of each destination
//! (#823).
//!
//! The node never says where it paid: `purchase-completed` carries nothing.
//! So this device keeps its own record of what it submitted — the Lightning
//! address sent with the take, each invoice or address sent afterwards, with
//! how it was chosen — and marks each one from the node's payout messages:
//!
//! | message | applies to the latest open destination |
//! |---|---|
//! | `payment-failed` (first failure only) | `Retrying`, with the node's attempt count |
//! | `add-invoice` on a settled escrow | `Failed`: the node gave up and wants another |
//! | `purchase-completed` | `Paid` |
//!
//! "Open" is `Submitted` or `Retrying`; every other outcome is final, so a
//! replayed message finds nothing left to mark. The callers also apply the
//! status cursor first, so a message older than one already applied never
//! reaches here.
//!
//! The messages name no destination, so at most one should be open. When
//! the node acknowledges a submission, every earlier open one is `Replaced`:
//! the node took the new one in its place. A submission the node never
//! answered leaves the earlier one open too, and then a payment cannot be
//! told apart: every open one becomes `MaybePaid` rather than a guess
//! (PR #824 review).
//!
//! The acknowledgement is recorded by the dispatcher that matches its nonce,
//! also once the caller stopped waiting, and it settles a `MaybePaid` filed
//! before it: the public `success` arrives on another subscription, so the
//! two can be written in either order.
//!
//! Stored as JSON under `payout_route:<order_id>`, scoped by the trade key
//! index like the payout amount: a later take starts a new record, and the
//! key goes with the row (`wipe_trade_row`, `clear_maker_step_start`) and
//! with the identity (`IDENTITY_SCOPED_PREFIXES`).
